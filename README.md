About
------
EAP network variables read/write utility.
Probably incomplete, but works for simple read/write network variables
on Beckhoff systems

Beckhoff EAP read/write tool
----------------------------
EAP = EtherCat Automation Protocol
This tool can be used for reading/writing EAP variables from a linux system.

See more on https://www.ethercat.org/en/downloads/downloads_BB6D7FF18F2B47DDB3474168D50EE864.htm


Notes
--------
This software will most probably not work on non linux systems without modifications

EAP traffic is flooding data, so ensure your network can handle this.
