Beckhoff EAP read/write tool
----------------------------
EAP = EtherCat Automation Protocol
This tool can be used for reading/writing EAP variables from a linux system.


Notes
--------
This software will most probably not work on non linux systems without modifications

EAP traffic is flooding data, so ensure your network can handle this.
